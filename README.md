# Introduction-to-ML-Models
In this repository, I will share a notebook on how to perform machine learning classification and prediction, complete with detailed explanations of the code. I will continuously update this notebook with all the resources you need to become a skilled researcher or data scientist.

## ML_Prediction
Notebooks under this section show how to preprocess numeric and categorical data, perform feature selection, make predictions with a stacking model, and fine-tune model parameters using Grid Search. The dataset used is from the Kaggle competition, available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data.
