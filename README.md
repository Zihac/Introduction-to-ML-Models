# Introduction-to-ML-Models
In this repository, I will share a notebook on how to perform machine learning classification and prediction, complete with detailed explanations of the code. I will continuously update this notebook with all the resources you need to become a skilled researcher or data scientist.

**I recommend opening my notebook on https://nbviewer.org/ for full visibility, as GitHub may truncate the code display. This can be done by simply copy and paste the GitHub link into nbviewer.**

## ML_Prediction
Notebooks under this section show 
1. how to preprocess numeric and categorical data
2. how to perform feature selection
3. how to make predictions with a stacking model
4. how to fine-tune model parameters using Grid Search

The dataset used is from the Kaggle competition, available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data.
