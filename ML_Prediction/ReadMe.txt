This notebook demonstrates:
1. how to preprocess numeric and categorical data
2. how to perform feature selection
3. how to make predictions with a stacking model
4. how to fine-tune model parameters using Grid Search. 

The dataset used is from the Kaggle competition, available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data.

I recommend opening my notebook on https://nbviewer.org/ for full visibility, as GitHub may truncate the code display. This can be done by simply copy and paste https://github.com/Zihac/Introduction-to-ML-Models/blob/main/ML_Prediction/house-price-prediction-begining.ipynb into nbviewer.
